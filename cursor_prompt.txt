I want to implement a custom bundle widget for my shopify store - I sell XX

Here's my info:


storeDomain "XXX.myshopify.com"
storefrontAccessToken "XXX" <- REPLACE WITH A SHOPIFY STOREFRONT ACCESS TOKEN

I want to create a bundle widget for my dynamic bundle with id 8138138353916  <-- REPLACE WITH ACTUAL PRODUCT ID FROM YOUR STORE

use the instructions from @working_with_recharge_bundles_llms.txt to create the bundle.
