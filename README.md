    storeDomain: 'https://rc-bundles.myshopify.com',
    storefrontAccessToken: 'ef69584f646c3ea0cfbe978d067d113d',

    appName: 'Custom Food Bundle Widget',

};
```

## How It Works

1. **Bundle Loading**: The widget loads bundle configuration from Recharge using the CDN API
2. **Variant Selection**: Customers choose their preferred bundle size
3. **Collection Navigation**: Customers can browse different food categories/collections
4. **Product Selection**: Add/remove items with quantity controls
5. **Real-time Validation**: Bundle rules are enforced in real-time
6. **Cart Integration**: Uses Recharge SDK to properly format bundle items for cart

## Bundle Rules

The widget automatically extracts and enforces bundle rules from your Recharge configuration:

- **Bundle Size Constraints**: Min/max total items in the bundle
- **Collection Constraints**: Per-collection min/max item requirements
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation with clear error messages

2. **Update configuration** if needed (store domain, access tokens, bundle ID)

4. **Customize styling** to match your brand if desired
